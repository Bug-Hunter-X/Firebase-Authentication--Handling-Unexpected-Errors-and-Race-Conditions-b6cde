# Firebase Authentication: Handling Unexpected Errors and Race Conditions

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Firebase Authentication related to unexpected errors and race conditions that occur during asynchronous operations. The bug involves scenarios where silent sign-in fails without providing clear error messages and race conditions that arise when combining multiple listeners or concurrent operations.

## Bug Description

The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases code that attempts silent sign-in.  Under certain network conditions or with invalid credentials, this can fail silently without useful error messages. Additional code illustrates a race condition where multiple listeners lead to unpredictable outcomes. 

## Solution

The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides a solution that addresses these issues.  It leverages proper error handling techniques to catch and handle potential exceptions.  The solution improves asynchronous operation management to prevent race conditions, potentially using promises and async/await for better control and readability.

## Setup

1.  Install the Firebase JS SDK:
```bash
npm install firebase
```
2.  Configure your Firebase project and include the necessary credentials.
3. Run `firebaseBug.js` and `firebaseBugSolution.js` to observe the behavior of both the original code and the solution.
