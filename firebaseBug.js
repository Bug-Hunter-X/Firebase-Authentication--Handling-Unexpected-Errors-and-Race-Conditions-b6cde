The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's credential is invalid or if there's a network issue during authentication.  For instance, a silent sign-in attempt might fail without providing clear error messages, making debugging difficult.  Another problem is that when dealing with multiple listeners or concurrent operations, subtle race conditions can occur, leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures. This can happen when you mix asynchronous operations with real-time database listeners.
